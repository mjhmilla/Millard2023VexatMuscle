The file simulationParametersHerzogLeonard2002.csv contains the best starting normalized length (lceN) of the simulated CE that matches the data of Herzog and Leonard 2002. From the experiment you would expect lceN to be exactly 1.0. However, I find that a value of lceN=0.96 fits much better. As I have found this value by hand, and have not automated the process of solving for it, I'm storing this parameter in a csv file.
